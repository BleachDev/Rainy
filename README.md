A weather app i made because i wanted to make something "simple" for my watch (And Garmins weather app kinda sucks).  
The app is completely free, has more features, is more accurate and is prettier than Garmins weather app!

App supports most (CIQ 3.0+) watches and a few Edge devices.  
Download on the [Connect IQ store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e7c0c39c-cb76-475f-b5bc-7811b0fee104).

## 1.x Branch

This is the 1.x version which is a "Widget" and has less available memory but supports Glance View on more devices.  
This branch only has the base features but supports as many devices as possible.
