A weather app i made because i wanted to make something "simple" for my watch (And Garmins weather app kinda sucks).  
The app has more features, is more accurate and is prettier than Garmins weather app!

App supports most (CIQ 3.0+) watches and a few Edge devices.  
Download on the [Connect IQ store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e7c0c39c-cb76-475f-b5bc-7811b0fee104).

## 2.x Branch

This is the 2.x version (Pro Version) which is a "Device App" and has more available memory.  
This branch has more features than 1.x but drops support for Instinct watches.
