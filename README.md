# Yr For Garmin

A weather app i made because i wanted to make something "simple" for my watch (And Garmins weather app kinda sucks).  
The app is completely free, has more features, is more accurate and is prettier than Garmins weather app.

Supports <span title="Literally just a lie, some old watch are not supported.">all<sup>[*]</sup></span> Garmin watches.
